# Avalancher

## Introduction

A parody of the classic Tetris game. 

## How to play

The game comes with the same seven tetrominoes: I, O, T, S, Z, J, and L. The objective is to see how long you can last without the stacked shapes reaching the top and going out of bounds. To ensure that does not happen, you have to fill an entire row for it to be eliminated, thus reducing the height of the whole stack. I also implemented power-ups such as a 'slow time' button that slows down the shapes' dropping speed. allowing you more time to think about where to place them effectively.
